Folks outside of major cities often have to travel to a more prominent nearby city to engage in some economic and social activities. Whether that means a resident of a rural area travelling into a small town to go to the grocery, a small town resident going to a small city to go to a shopping mall, a resident of a small city going to a larger city to fly out of the ariport, or even moving to a regional economic hub to get a better job. My theory is that through these moves cultural connections are built up that might explain and more sharply define the boundaries of America's cultural regions and answer questions like: Is Memphis Braves country? Where in NoVa do you leave the South? How should we design regional transportation infrastructure?
